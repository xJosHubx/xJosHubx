- Hi, I’m Josh.
   I think the aspect of being able to access my website anywhere in the world, and update, moderate, or manipulate it,  is what I both crave and enjoy about web development. Also the challenge is part of the fun. Getting something working is a very rewarding and joyful experience. As a hobby I like building people up to see what they will accomplish when they believe in themselves. 
- I’m currently using- Vanilla JS, HTML, CSS || Currently learning TS, MERN, SQL .
- I’m looking for work, and to be part of a team. Would prefer web dev but I'm open to and capable of new things. 
- Email me at hhjoshhh@gmail.com.
- 
- You're awesome, and have a great day.
